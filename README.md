# Nguyen-Thi-Hong-Nhung
I'm a fourth-year student at Eastern International University
With a strong passion for people and organizational development, I’m pursuing a concentration in Human Resources Management. I’ve also developed a deep interest in data analytics after recognizing its importance in improving workforce planning and enhancing employee performance. In the future, I aim to combine my analytical and HR skills to create data-driven strategies that support employee growth and strengthen organizational effectiveness.
